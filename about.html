					<h2>WHY MIRA! WHY NOW?</h2>
					<p>Inequitable institutions and power structures in tech amplifies bias and inequities in other systems and structures. Recent crises have made the inequities and failures of our systems much more visible and made solving these problems even more urgent.  The pandemic, the protests, and systemic responses have  exacerbated the challenges faced by  our communities, amplifying the lack of equitable access to essential resources, connection, justice, and information.</p>
					<p>We can do far better—but changing all this will require bold vision. With great disruption comes the opportunity for resilient change, and there has never been a more critical time to reimagine the institutions around technology.</p>
					
					<p>Achieving this bold vision of change is why we’ve created MIRA!, right here and now. MIRA! (Mobilize Innovation, Reimagine Agency) mobilizes communities and networks around an urgent need to harness innovation in reflection of this transformative time, in service to us all and reimagines how we lead, learn, create, and connect — and build the future we want.</p>
					<h2>WHAT DOES MIRA! DO:</h2>
					<p>As common stakeholders in the endeavor of reimagining institutions and systems around tech, we deploy thoughtful collaboration across a variety of sectors and expertise, recalibrating how we solve problems together—developing and adopting technology when necessary and appropriate. To accomplish this effectively and fairly, we create a more universally-accessible and relevant  ecosystem to learn,  ideate, research, design, and deploy our emergent solutions. Success leads to a redistribution of power that benefits all of us, even as it sparks our ability to meet each of our communities’ unique needs.</p>
					<h2>We envision that MIRA! will: 	</h2>
					<p>Create and serve as a trusted host for collaborative spaces (such as convenings, projects, labs, and residencies) that bring together diverse stakeholders to engage with the creation and impacts of technology and policy.</p>
					<p>Mobilize and support communities through a range of projects and participatory, community-driven research to create and advocate for  strategies, responses, and policies that emphasize equity and social impact.</p>
					<p>Create  inclusive and innovative  opportunities for lifelong professional learning, trainings, and credentials related to creative and emergent technology and entrepreneurship that empower and support a diverse community of practitioners to 	become inventors, educators, and leaders. </p>
					<p>Co-create the design, creation, and implementation of toolkits in corporations, civic institutions, community organisations, and education (k-Ph.D.) institutions. emphasize  “ train the trainers/leaders” toolkits recognizing that true inclusion and equity arises from having a voice in high-level decision-making.</p>
					<p>Collaborate with (and implement certification programs around) technology companies to implement innovative, community-centric practices and policies.</p>
